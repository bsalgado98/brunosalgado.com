My resume website, meant to resemble the Windows 98 operating system.

This site is a pure frontend project built using only React (early 2019 create-react-app) and deployed using Firebase.

## Motivation
I've always been fascinated by retro-themed things and especially pioneering technologies like Windows 98. I felt like going for an operating system theme and presenting it as a single page application was a good challenge and place to start.
This project was my first hands-on experience learning and using React. I learned a lot of basic web development skills through this endeavour.
